// Full agent in meetings (controlclaw docs/plans/meeting-full-agent.md). With the owner's "Full
// agent" setting, and only in a meeting an owner or admin sent the agent to (the firewall marks
// the media lease, and the vm-agent writes `full: true` to lease.json), the main agent answers a
// request to act with CC_TASK (actions.js) instead of leaving it for the owner. The request then
// runs here as a normal full agent turn (`openclaw agent`), in the background, with a session of
// its own, so it shows in the OpenClaw dashboard. The voice says "ok, on it" at once and the
// result when the run ends: through the voice session open at that moment (setSpeaker), or, when
// none is, through the next one. When the meeting is over, the owner gets the result in their
// direct chat, if they have one. Every task is kept in tasks/<meeting id>.json, which the vm-agent
// shows on the meeting's page.
//
// A follow-up (CC_TASK with `continue: n`, "click the pulping stage" after task 1 built the page) goes
// on in task n's session, which has the earlier work, with a short message and not the whole task
// preamble again. A task and its follow-ups are one lane: one run at a time, a follow-up asked while
// the task runs waits for it. A lane holds one of the MAX_RUNNING places from its first run until its
// last; follow-ups do not count against MAX_TASKS but have their own MAX_FOLLOW_UPS per task.
//
// The run goes out through the firewall like every other run: its rules and confirmation codes
// apply. Nothing from the meeting is logged here; the tasks file holds the request, the caption
// name of whoever asked, and the one-line result.
