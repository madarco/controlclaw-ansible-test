// Requests to act, made in a meeting (controlclaw docs/plans/meet-always-listening.md, "Requests to
// act"). The voice model cannot act and does not refuse: it delegates, like a lookup. The consult
// that answers it runs OpenClaw's `safe-read-only` tool policy (read, web and memory tools), so the
// main agent cannot act either; it decides by the owner's standing orders for meetings in AGENTS.md
// and answers with one marker, which has to be its whole answer:
//   CC_REMINDER {"at","text"}            a reminder for the owner: created here, as a one-shot
//                                        OpenClaw automation that sends the text to the owner's
//                                        direct chat (never a group or "last chat"). Plain text, no
//                                        agent run, at most MAX_REMINDERS a meeting, and only while
//                                        the owner's "People in a meeting can set reminders for you"
//                                        setting is on.
//   CC_NEEDS_OWNER {"request","allowed"} anything else: not done; written to the meeting's voice log
//                                        as a `request` line.
//   CC_TASK {"task"}                     Full agent (controlclaw docs/plans/meeting-full-agent.md), only
//                                        offered when the meeting's lease says so: anything else is
//                                        done by a full agent run in the background (tasks.js).
//   CC_PRESENT {"mode"}                  presenting (controlclaw docs/plans/meeting-present.md), only
//                                        offered when the meeting's lease allows it: "browser" shows
//                                        the agent's browser to the meeting, "stop" ends it (present.js).
// Hook for T-meetpost (PR #353): once its followUp.requests exist, the vm-agent files the `request`
// lines there. `suggestedAllowed` is the consult model's own reading of the standing orders, from a
// run that read meeting speech: #353 must decide from the standing orders itself and never act on it.
